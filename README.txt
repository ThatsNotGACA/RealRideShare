This program simulates a road system with cars and people moving between stations. The main files of the program are Person, Car, Road, and Station. A Person has a starting location, a destination, and a direction. Cars can pick up passengers, move toward their destination, and unload passengers when they arrive. The Road class manages the cars and people, handling the process of picking up passengers and moving cars along the road. Each Station represents a location along the road where people can wait for a ride. Each station has three lists: one for people waiting to travel left, one for those waiting to travel right, and one for those who have completed. The tester simulates cars moving toward their destination, picking up passengers, and unloading them when they arrive. The output includes the state of the cars, people, and the road after each action, such as adding passengers, moving cars, and unloading passengers.
